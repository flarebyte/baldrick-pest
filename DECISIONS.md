# Architecture decision records

An [architecture
decision](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records)
is a software design choice that evaluates:

-   a functional requirement (features).
-   a non-functional requirement (technologies, methodologies, libraries).

The purpose is to understand the reasons behind the current architecture, so
they can be carried-on or re-visited in the future.

In an alchemist workshop in Elizabethan England, a simple-minded servant is
tidying up turnips and potions near a small square window in the background.
In the foreground, there’s a table with potions and alchemist apparatus. The
light from the window shines on a wooden hamster wheel in the middle of the
room, with a couple of rats running frantically. The scene has a dark
satirical tone mocking Elizabethan England’s social norms and customs.
